# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project for Coursera Datascience Specialization

# Project Goals
* create run_analysis.R that meets criteria below
* create codebook for produced dataset
* create readme
* publish project on github

# What Script Does
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Usage 
1. Make sure directory "UCI HAR Dataset", files "dataFiles.zip" and "tidy_dataset.txt" don't exist in your current working directory
2. Make sure you have permissions to read and write to your current working directory
3. run_analysis.R
